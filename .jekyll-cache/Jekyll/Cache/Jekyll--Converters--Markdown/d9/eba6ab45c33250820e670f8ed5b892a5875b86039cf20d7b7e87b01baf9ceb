<p>The project was created by <a href="https://overthebridge.org">Over the Bridge</a>, an organization dedicated to increase awareness on mental health and substance abuse in the music industry, trying to denormalize and remove the glamour around such illnesses within the music community.</p>

<p>They are using Googleâ€™s <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org">Magenta</a>, which is a neural network that precisely was conceived to explore the role of machine learning within the creative process. Magenta has been used to create a brand new â€œBeatlesâ€ song or even there was a band that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/yachts-chain-tripping-is-a-new-landmark-for-ai-music-an-album-that-doesnt-suck/">used it to write a full album</a> in 2019.</p>

<p>Think about it, imagine one of this new songs becomes a massive hit with millions of youtube views and spotify streams, who can claim the royalties generated?</p>

<p>Now, creative works qualify for copyright protection if they are original, with most definitions of originality requiring a human author.  â€œregister an original work of authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being.â€</p>

<p>So as we currently stand, a human author is required to grant a copyright, which makes sense, there is no point of having a neural network be the beneficiary of royalties of a creative work (no bank would open an account for them anyways, lol).</p>
